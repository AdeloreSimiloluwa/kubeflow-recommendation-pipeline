# Kubeflow Recommendation Pipeline

## Mavencode

[MavenCode](https://www.mavencode.com/) is a provider of consulting services and expertise for building and implementing large scale distributed reactive backend systems for processing massive large scale datasets. We are responsible for putting this open source project together. The goal is to create a community for the development of a recommenntdation system that would be applied in different use cases like ecommerce, health etc. 

## Project Overview
This project explains the implementation technique for Collaborative-filtering workflow implementation for model training and deployment.Collaborative-filtering system operates by finding users with similar interests and provides recommendations to a user based on a similar interest accrued over time with another. This system will be designed to predict a userâ€™s interest or suggest likely products the user might be interested in. At the end of this project, we will have a workflow process in place for building API for training and serving recommendation of products.
